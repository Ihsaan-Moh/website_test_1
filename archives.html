                                             and his contributions to science.A 5 minute video about Michael Faraday is given to participants,
                                              then a crossword puzzle based on the given video was provided to the participants.Competitors
                                               were required to fill up the crossword puzzle and upload the screenshot in Google form.

                                            The event comprised of three levels. First being a “crossword”, followed by “republic”, which was a hangman level and finally “tap a tile” where the contestants were asked to identify the personality behind the tiles. The event was a great start for the future events. The coordination between the team members was really appreciable. This was a good way to pave bonds between the newly formed groups of members.
